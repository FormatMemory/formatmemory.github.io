            <p>In last XX years, I've found my hobbies, loved ones and lifelong friendships.</p>
            <p>I've been through a big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Sichuan_earthquake">earthquake</a> and seem live and dead as a victim as well as a volunteer.</p>
            <p>From there, I saw how weak and impuissant, as human beings, we can be, and how strong and humanistic we also can be, as human beings.</p>
            <p>I went to college in China and graduate school in the U.S. I am full of curiosity about almost everything in life.</p>
            <p>I enjoy helping people with my skills as well as expericeces and believe that I can make a difference in the world.</p>
            <p>Still working on defining myself. I don't want to be hurry.</p>
            <p>Life goes on. Let's see what's going to happen next...</p>
