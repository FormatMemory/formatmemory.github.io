    <p>In last 20+ years, I've found my hobbies, loved ones and lifelong friendships. I've been through a big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Sichuan_earthquake">earthquake</a> and seem live and dead as a victim as well as a volunteer. From there, I saw how weak and impuissant, as human beings, we can be, and how strong and humanistic we also can be, as human beings. I went to college in China and graduate school in the U.S. I am full of curiosity about almost everything in life, except politics. I enjoy helping people with my skills as well as expericeces and believe that I can make a difference in the world.</p>
    <p>Still working on defining myself. Maybe I don't have to hurry.</p>
    <p>Life goes on. Let's see what's going to happen next...</p>
